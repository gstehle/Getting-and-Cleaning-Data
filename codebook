Data Set Information:

**UPDATED DATA SET INFORMATION**

The names in the tidy data set are named by the following conventions:

1) present if the variable is the 'angle' between two other variables
2) domain (time or frequency)
3) measurement (body acceleration, body jerk, gravity acceleration, angular acceleration, angular jerk)
4) present if the variable is a magnitude (see #5)
5) operation performed on measurement (mean or standard deviation)
6) present if the variable is a frequency mean
7) present if the variable is not a magnitude, denotes which axis (x,y,z) is being measured

**ORIGINAL DATA SET INFORMATION**

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six 
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on 
the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a 
constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly 
partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding 
windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion 
components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed 
to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 
features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset. 

A video of the experiment including an example of the 6 recorded activities with one of the participants can be seen in the following

An updated version of this dataset can be found at [Web Link]. It includes labels of postural transitions between activities and also 
the full raw inertial signals instead of the ones pre-processed into windows.

Attribute Information:

For each record in the dataset it is provided: 
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
